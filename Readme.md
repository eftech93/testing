# Testing and QA on software development

Testing activities are usually perform at defferent levels during the develpment of a solution, software, apps etc. 

As defined by len bas et al, testing (software testeability) refers to the ability in which it can be demonstrated that a software fails when spected.

They also define a model of testing, which will be use as base of the documentation.

The testing model defined by them contains 2 main elements and 3 sources. The main elements are the program to be executed and the oracle which makes the decision whether or not the test fail. 

The program source is the input for the execution, and the oracle source is the input for the execution, the internal state of the execution and the output of the program.


The oracle takes those imputs to evaluate if the output, internal state are the adecuate base on the imput.

Note: it's really important to know, that the program must be deterministic.

## Validation and Verication

Validation: against the client

Verification: against the product specification

## Classifcation on Testing

While performing testing there are different ways to classifie the activities performed:

- By level
- By code access

### Classification by Level

#### Levels 

Levels of testing:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

##### Unit testing

### Classification by code access

#### Black box
#### White box
