# Unit tests

What's an unit test?

Level of testing that focuses on single units of execution (blocks, methods, functions, classes, processes). It does not include dependencies of those blocks. It can verify internal state changes, output or code execution.

## How Unit Test works?

As per shown in the sequence diagram, the testing oracle defines the input and the expected output from the code to be tested. And then executes the function/class, block of code, and the it determines whether or not the output is correct.

### How to Unit Test a block of code

Let say, we have the next example:

Where A, B, C, D, E and H are functions defined in a program...
